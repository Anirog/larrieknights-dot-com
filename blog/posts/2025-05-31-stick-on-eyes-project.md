It all started late one night shopping on Amazon in January 2020, as I was browsing the virtual aisles looking at expensive cameras and headphones I didn’t need, I looked up and noticed the note I have permanently on my desk, that reads “Stop Buying Stuff”

Just as I was about to take heed of my note I thought no, I’m going to buy something I deserve it, but just buy something cheap and cheerful, this decision turned into the stick on eyes project, with the purchase of these.
