Lucky isn’t the kind of dog who makes a fuss. She’s calm, gentle, and always close by — not in a needy way, just quietly present. If I move to another room, she often follows. If I sit down, she’ll settle nearby. It’s like she simply wants to be where I am.

She has a way of watching the world that feels thoughtful. Sometimes I catch her sitting in the sun, completely still, as if she’s taking everything in. Other times, she curls up in her favourite spot and just rests — no drama, no noise, just peace.

There’s something comforting about having her around. She doesn’t ask for much. Just to be near. And over time, that quiet presence has become part of my day — grounding, familiar, and somehow essential.

These four photos capture a little of who she is. No posing, no tricks. Just Lucky being Lucky.
