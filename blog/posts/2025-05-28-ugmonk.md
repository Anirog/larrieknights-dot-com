I saw the ugmonk analog productivity card holder on YouTube. Itâ€™s a nice wooden card holder that holds productivity cards. There are three different cards: Today, Next and Someday.

You write to-dos on the cards, then mark the cards using different symbols based on what stage you are at with them.
