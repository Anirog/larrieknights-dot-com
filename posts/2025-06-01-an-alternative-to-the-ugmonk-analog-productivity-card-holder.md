I saw the ugmonk analog productivity card holder on YouTube it's a nice wooden card holder that holds productivity cards. There are three different cards: Today, Next and Someday.

You write to-dos on the cards then mark the cards using different symbols based on what stage you are at with them.

It's lovely but expensive at £86 for the starter kit, then you have to take into account the ongoing cost of buying new cards, the cards cost £31 for a pack, each pack contains 50 cards.

Because of the price and because ugmonk ships from the USA (often a lot of hassle in the UK) I started looking for an alternative and found exactly what I was looking for on Etsy a nice 3D printed to-do list card holder, that so far has been a nice addition to my desk setup.

The card holder is £15.99 and uses 3x5 inch index cards, that are easily available and cost about £7 for a pack of 100 cards on Amazon.

I'm using a version of the dash plus productivity system by Richard Rhone on my cards.
