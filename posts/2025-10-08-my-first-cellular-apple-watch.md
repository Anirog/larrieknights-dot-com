I’ve been using a cellular Apple Watch for the first time, and it’s been a small but meaningful upgrade.  

When I go walking or cycling, I prefer not to take my phone with me — it’s one less distraction. But I still like listening to podcasts or music, and now I can do that directly from my wrist. I can also make and receive phone calls, and even send and receive text messages when I’m out.

It feels freeing to leave my phone behind but still stay connected in a light, minimal way.

Although it’s not perfect:

1. The mobile connection occasionally stops working. The only reliable fix I’ve found is to unpair and re-pair the watch, which resets it to factory settings — mildly annoying.
2. To send or receive standard text messages, your paired iPhone needs to be powered on (it doesn’t need to be with you). iMessage, however, works fine without it.

Still, despite the quirks, I like having the choice to disconnect a little — while staying connected just enough.
