## The Rules

1. **Finish the Race**
2. **Don't be a Victim**
3. **Ubuntu is a Way of Life**
4. **Pressure is a privilege**
5. **Champions Keep Moving Forward**

The dictionary definition of **Ubuntu** is:

> A quality that includes the essential human virtues; compassion and humanity.

The documentary had more to say about Ubuntu and what it means:

> A solitary human being is a contradiction in terms. I have to learn from other human beings how to be human.
>
> — Desmond Tutu

A person is a person through other people, I can't be all I can be unless you can be all you can be.

I can never be threatened by you because you're good, because the better you are the better I am.
