# Personal Website Project

This project generates my personal website [larrieknights.com](https://larrieknights.com) including:

- A markdown-based blog with tags, pagination and search
- A static site generator that converts markdown to HTML
- Clean, minimal styling using plain CSS
- Automation scripts written in Python
- Static site output for GitHub Pages deployment

## Key Scripts

- `new_post.py` – Creates a new markdown file with frontmatter for blog
- `generate_blog.py` – Converts markdown blog posts to HTML using Jinja

## Notes

- Uses plain CSS only (no SCSS, no build tools)
- Hosted on GitHub Pages via the `docs/` folder
- Designed for simplicity, readability, and fast load times
